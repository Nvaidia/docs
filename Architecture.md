JeetForce AI's architecture is designed to seamlessly integrate AI-driven automation with decentralized governance, focusing on computational asset management and hosting negotiations. Here's a brief overview:

  

- JeetForce Control Plane: This is the core system where AI functionalities are managed. It can be either self-hosted or managed, providing flexibility based on the DAO's preferences. It includes:
    
    - Function Registry: A component for registering various AI functions tailored for asset management, negotiation, and blockchain integration.
        
    - Durable Execution Engine: Ensures the persistent and reliable execution of AI tasks, crucial for long-term negotiations and asset management.
        
    - Re-Act Agent: An AI agent capable of real-time reactions to market changes or DAO decisions, utilizing frameworks like ElizaOS for dynamic decision-making and action generation.
        
    - LLM Routing: Manages the distribution of tasks to different Large Language Models for various AI-driven processes, optimizing for efficiency and cost.
        
- API Integration: A REST API serves as the communication bridge between the JeetForce Control Plane and external systems, facilitating interactions with:
    
    - Your VPC (Virtual Private Cloud): Where business logic resides, integrating with cloud services like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform for executing operations related to AI and blockchain.
        
    - JeetForce SDK: Provides developers with tools in languages like TypeScript, Go, and C# to integrate AI functionality into existing or new applications, ensuring broad compatibility and ease of development.
        
- Blockchain Integration: The architecture supports direct interaction with blockchain technologies, allowing for:
    
    - DAO Governance: Integration with smart contracts or governance plugins to ensure AI actions align with community decisions.
        
    - On-Chain to Off-Chain Operations: Enabling decentralized entities to manage computational resources off-chain while maintaining governance on-chain.
        
- Community Engagement: The system includes interfaces for community interaction, where AI agents can communicate updates, negotiate terms, or provide insights, enhancing transparency and participation in DAO operations.
    
- Vector Store: Utilizes vector databases like Weaviate or Pinecone for efficient data retrieval and management, crucial for AI learning, memory retention, and decision-making processes.
